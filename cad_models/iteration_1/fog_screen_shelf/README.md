# Fog Screen Shelf Installation Instructions

The files included for the fog screen shelf are both the .SLDPRT file for any editing and improvements, and the .stl file to facilitate 3D-printing. 

The fog screen shelf should be installed at an angle of 19 degrees counterclockwise with respect to the tangent line at the front edge of the Fetch robot base. The image below further elaborates on how the shelf should be installed. The shelf is the square in red, the blue circles are where the screws will be conneced to the Fetch robot base, and the horizontal red line is the tangent line the fog screen should be angled at 19 degrees with respect to.
