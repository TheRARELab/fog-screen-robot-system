# Fog Screen Device Bracket Installation Instructions

This repo has the bracket designs used for fixing the fog screen device on top of the shelf so it does not fall off when the robot is moving. There are 3 brackets (left, right, and back) and an included assembly file showing how the shelf, brackets, and fog screen device model are put together. Both the STL and SolidWorks part files (SLDPRT) are included for all the parts in case any change is required.

To install, screw the brackets to the appropriate areas as indicated in the picture below in red circles using M5 bolts and nuts. The fog screen device should then be placed in between the barriers which will prevent it from falling when the Fetch robot is moving.
